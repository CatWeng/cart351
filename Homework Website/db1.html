     <h3>1.2</h3>
     <br>
     The letter I chose for this assignment is the letter “C”. I chose it because it’s the first letter of my name so it’s a very familiar letter to me. I like how it has such a simple shape that you can find it in almost anything- the arch of a doorway, the crescent moon, etc.

    <h3>1.3</h3>
    For the manipulation of my letter,
    none of the examples I found was something I could realistically take and manipulate so I created my own.
    This was done by dropping nail polish into water to create a mosaic of varied colours.
    Each nail polish interacted with each other and the water differently to create a vivid mix of hues.

    <h3>1.4</h3>
    <br>
    <br>
    1. For this treatment I keep the original form of the poem but overlapped the text with itself several times.
    I subtracted and adding until the text had a fragmented but still readable appearance.
    Inspired by the sense of despair in the poem.

    2. For this treatment, I found an illustration (artwork by Kuvshinov Illya)
    which fit the feeling I got from the poem.
    I highlighted the word ‘poem’ each time it appeared and then played around with the text
     until I liked the ‘overwhelming’ look of the image.

    3. For the last treatment,
    I wanted to express the building frustration felt by the woman in the poem and her calm conclusion.
    For this I used the Zalgo text generator, a generator which stacks characters onto words,
     to create a feeling of insanity.
